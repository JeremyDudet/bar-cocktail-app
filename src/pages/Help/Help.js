        Guidlines:
          The one rule that all bartenders must know is this: Nothing is written in stone. 
          Every situation is different, different customers must be treated in different ways. 
          Although mixing drinks is akin to cookery in many respects, it is not an exact science. 
          Cocktailian bartenders are akin to chefs who specialize in sauces, soups, and stews - they should be able to experiment with recipes.
          The cocktail and mixed-drinks recipes, and the amounts given for ingredients are guidelines. 
          Prepare a drink exactly to recipe and you will end up with a well-balanced potion, 
          but if you decide that you enjoy, say, a Martini, more with a tad extra vermouth, you should feel free to follow your heart. To a point.
          Similar options apply to almost any drink you can name
          So where does this leave you when you're looking for someone to tell you exactly how to make a specific cocktail? 
          As with culinary endeavors, you should initially have a drink according to a standard recipe. Taste it, and if 
          The most important aspect of any cocktail or mixed drink is balance, 
          and althoughguidelines can be set to make, say, a Martini, this drink can vary considerably depending on:
          1. Which spirit is used? (gin or vodka)
          2. Which bottling of dry vermouth is used?
          3. Will you add olive brine to the Martini?
