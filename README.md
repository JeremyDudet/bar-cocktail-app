## How I worked in this project
My goal was to simulate a professional work environment. 
* I built this app based on Figma designs
* I worked with tasks on a Trello board.

## How to navigate this project

## Why I built the project this way
* create-react-app. I wanted to see what it is like to build a Single-Page-Application with client-side rendering.
* styled-components is a great library for styling, it includes an auto-prefixer, uses scoped classes and allows a seemless integration with JS
* My plan is to eventually become a full-stack developer. But for the beginning I focus on the Frontend. That's why I chose to use Firebase rather than create a custom server and database. I have only basic backend knowledge. 

## If I had more time I would change this:
* Setup continuous itegration to run tests and ESLint on every Pull Request
* Refactor some of the code. 
* Add end-to-end tests with Cypress
